/**
 * Re-pulls the current route's server content when this tab regains focus, so
 * CMS edits published while you were in the CMS tab appear without a manual
 * reload. Uses router.refresh() — it re-renders the server components in place
 * (no full page reload; scroll position and client state are preserved) and,
 * because the backend already purged the ISR cache for the changed path on
 * publish (see revalidate.service.ts), the refetch returns the fresh content.
 *
 * Focus-only by design: it fires when the tab becomes visible/focused, never on
 * an interval, so it adds no recurring load for public visitors. Disabled inside
 * the CMS live-preview iframe (?preview=1), which has its own postMessage-based
 * live update and must not be reset by a refresh.
